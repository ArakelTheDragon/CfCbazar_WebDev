It uses a random generated nonce trying to find the nonce instead of brute forcing the nonce from 0 to max value. Alpha tested. We haven't hit a real block. Has a web dashboard(IP can be found from serial monitor), connects to eu3.solopool.org:8005. 200 WorkTokens were used to make  this project.(Thats us working for 200 hours).",
