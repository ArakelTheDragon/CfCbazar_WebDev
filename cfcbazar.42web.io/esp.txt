Our latest project is the ESP8266 cube. It's a web server that you can host on the ESP and it allows you to upload premade HTML/JS files. You can setup a 2 megabyte server which is only accessible from the local network from it's local IP or you can setup global access from your public IP. It can be used for web based games like our game arcade ESP, tools accessible only to employees, corporate & special facility projects. It's like a local only library of articles, tools & entertainment which can work even if you are offline. Or you can control access based on rolles. Link is in the comments.
