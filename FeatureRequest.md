# ðŸš€ Feature Request: WorkToken Utility System â€” Platform Credits Workflow

## Summary

Introduce a unified credit system for CfCbazar where users deposit WorkTokens, WorkTHR, or BNB to their account. These deposits are converted into **platform credits**, which are consumed as users trigger work across ESP devices or online tools. This system enables scalable monetization, modular proof-of-work utility, and seamless integration with both hardware and software features.

## ðŸ”§ Workflow Overview

### 1. User Registration
- Users create an account on the CfCbazar platform.
- Each account includes:
  - Email
  - Wallet address (optional)
  - Linked ESP devices (via MAC address)

### 2. Token Deposit
- Users deposit one of the following:
  - `WorkTokens` (native utility token)
  - `WorkTHR` (alternate token for rewards/staking)
  - `BNB` (fallback currency for conversion)
- Deposits are converted into **platform credits** at a dynamic rate.

### 3. Credit Balance
- Dashboard displays:
  - Total platform credits
  - Breakdown by source (WorkToken, WorkTHR, BNB)
  - Transaction history

### 4. Work Execution
- Credits are consumed when users trigger work:
  - **ESP Devices**: smart plug toggles, sensor logging, alerts
  - **Online Tools**: guide generation, dashboard builds, data parsing
- Each task has a defined **credit cost** based on complexity or duration.

### 5. Audit + Transparency
- Dashboard logs:
  - Work performed
  - Credits burned
  - Timestamp
  - Device or tool used

## ðŸ’° Monetization Model

- Credits = fuel for work.
- ESP devices and online tools consume credits as they perform useful tasks.
- Example use cases:
  - Smart plug toggling
  - Temperature/humidity logging
  - Leak detection alerts
  - Guide generation
  - Token dashboard builds

---

## ðŸ”® Future Extensions

- **Quest logic**: earn bonus credits for completing work bundles.
- **Referral rewards**: invite others and earn WorkTokens.
- **Tiered pricing**: premium features cost more credits.
- **Token staking**: lock WorkTHR to reduce credit burn rate.
- **Community tools**: allow users to submit tools that consume credits.

## ðŸ“Œ Implementation Notes

- ESP firmware must support:
  - OTA updates
  - Diagnostics
  - API polling
  - Offline fallback logic
- Platform must support:
  - Credit conversion logic
  - Secure API endpoints for device polling and command execution
  - Dashboard integration for credit tracking and work logs
